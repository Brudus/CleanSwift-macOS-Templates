This is a Clean Swift macOS template. Compared to the template of https://clean-swift.com/ it has the following modifications:

* Indent is changed to a standardized 4-spaces indent.
* Braces follow the OTBS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS).
* Deleted all example functions (doSomething, displaySomething, etc.), as well as the example models.
* Deleted the automatically created worker for each Scene.

Added features:
* macOS X support. The template will be visible in the macOS section when creating new files.
